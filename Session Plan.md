Notes:
- Ramp the tension SLOWLY:
	- first a few clues
	- then a disappearance,
	- then a distant (or radio) scream,
	- finally a gory dismemberment
- weaponize the cat (have it pop out to scare someone, ratchet the tension or simply be an omen)
- Yellow Goo as a Ticking Time Bomb
-

General
- describe the situation fully, lay out possible actions
- description should include all senses if possible
- Only call for rolls when necessary
- Set the stakes BEFORE asking for a roll
- Failure should always cause stuff to happen
	- They don't just miss, they sink further into panic and horror


#### Character creation

Setting spiel
- You are not brave adventurers, you are mostly blue collar working stiffs in a horrific future where your livelihood is down to the whims of mega-corporate overlords
- This is a horror movie, and it is very deadly, but you need to be ok with not playing it safe. Your characters death will likely be their most memorable scene. It is a horror movie...so go off alone, say things like "phew well I'm glad that is over", panic at inopportune moments
- Embrace risk, be the character you would scream at if watching a horror movie
- Survive, Save or Solve, you can often only pick two

Make characters

Understand that your characters stats represent how good they are at doing some on THE WORST DAY OF THEIR LIVES
- I will try not to call for a roll unless something is unclear, or extreme pressure is in play

Most things that you are trained in, or are in your inventory, you will NOT need to roll to use 

Test roll to understand system
- d100 (test a check and a save)
	- 000 is ZERO, not 100, this means your stat is telling your you exact chances to roll a success
	- Please tell me 1. what you rolled and 2. what the stat is (eg, I rolled 45 OVER 53, or I rolled 23 UNDER 53)
- xd10 (test a damage roll)
- d20 (test a panic roll)

#### Intro

On ship:
- The Ishiyama Dynamics C-Class Vessel, Callsign Tempest silently drifts through the inky darkness of space
- Interior of the ship is deathly silent, punctuated only but gentle clicks and whirrs
- A computer terminal flashes on, and words start flickering onto its blurry, scanline riddled surface:
	- APPROACHING YPSILON ASTEROID BELT. CYCLING CYRO-PODS
- The cyro pods slowly fade into light, and each begins to gently chug and creak, beginning the 'decanting' process
	- Each player hears a corporate jingle and corpo speak, while still slumbering:
	  
	  "Good morning valued contractor, please wait while we complete the awakening protocol for your Ishiyama Dynamics "Hypnos Ultra" Statis Unit. 
	  You have been suspended for ...29 DAYS.... 14 HOURS.

- Call for d100, lowest pod malfunctions, waking up the occupant prior to draining the nutrient ferro fluid. Occupant must make a fear save, and someone will need to assist in its opening somehow

**Crew mission:**
1. **Cargo Delivery** - Transport supply manifests to Ypsilon 14 mining facility
2. **Ore Collection** - Load processed ore shipments for transport, also retrieve specific Ore samples off Lead Engineer Mikhail Radimir
3. **Final Delivery** - Transport ore to Kepler Trade Hub for processing

- Your collection manifest needs to be signed off on by Sonya, Dana and Mike

Approaching the Ypslion 14 - hail will get no response for a time, let it stew and then have Sonya apologize and say that Mike was meant to be on rotation for docking bays this morning
#### Getting into the station
- Day shift is about to begin, but has been delayed by a broken freight elevator
- Sonya is beginning to think Mike might be missing and will greet the players, but then ask everyone you see whether they have seen Mike

	Inital NPC Locations:
	- Sonya in Workspace, opening the airlock to the players with the **COMPUTER TERMINAL**
		- Morgan + Rie in workspace and will begin to load cargo
		- Rosa also doing some diagnostics near the freight elevator, will tell Sonya the mine door is sending up some weird readings, might need repairs
	- Ashraf in spare bunk / hangout room, playing the game console, will grunt at players but wont look up
	- One bunk room is closed, Rie is sleeping in there (or doing drugs)
	- Jerome is showering, then will be clipping his beard
	- Dana + Kenji in mess, Dana attempting to flirt but Kenji being quiet and stoic

- Sonya says to make yourself comfortable while she goes over the paper work for the Cargo Transfer
	- grab a cup of recaf from the Mess and go get Dana's sign-off on your delivery manifest and see Mike for the samples you need
	- feel free to use whatever facilities the station has while you are here

- Morgan reports there are a few smaller crates missing that need to be loaded, they will be at the entrance to the mine he reckons, thinks Mike probably forgot to load them into the airlock for transfer

#### Omens 

- Once they get down into the mine, they feel a weird tingling as they pass through the fixed airlock, makes the hairs stand up on the back of their neck - THE MONSTER IS LOOSE
- Use the cat to scare them, then have the invisible monster corner a PC, knock something off a desk and then retreat when another person comes into the room
- Disappear another NPC
- Then either disappear with a scream, or an attack thwarted with bottle of distilled water spilled
