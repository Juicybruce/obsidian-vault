There are several security options that can be altered to change the way the broswer treats cookies:
	- Secure Flag - ensures the cookies are only transferred over HTTPS
	- HttpOnly - prevents access of the cookies by any JS on the page
	- SameSite - controls the behaviour of cookies when going between sites (can help prevent [[Cross-Site Forgery Attacks]])
