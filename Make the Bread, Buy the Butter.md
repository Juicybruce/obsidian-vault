*What You Should and Shouldn't Cook from Scratch - The author wrote this after getting laid off, and then spent a year investigating what was worth the extra effort of making from scratch. Each recipe is preceded by three things: Make it or buy it, Hassle and Cost - and the whole thing is written in a more down to earth, conversational fashion than in an omniscient authoritative voice like you find in some cookbooks.*
