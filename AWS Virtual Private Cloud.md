VPCs are:
- a virtual network within your AWS account
- they operate across **multiple AZs** and are thus **regionally resilient**
- by default they are **private and isolated**
	- EXCEPT for the default VPC, of which you can have **only one per region**
	- Custom VPCs are unlimited and can be configured however you like
