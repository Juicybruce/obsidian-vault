This is a support service which can be utilised by almost all other services within AWS. 

It handles the **Collecting and managing operational data** (any data generated by a service on how it runs, including logs)
- **Metrics** - measuring data relating to AWS products (CPU, disk-usage, network traffic), but **also** other places like on-premises environments or apps etc. 
	- Some metrics are gathered natively and by default (like CPU usage), some might require additional software like the CloudWatch Agent
- **Logs** - almost anything that logs can be ingested by CloudWatch Logs. A lot of this is done natively but for custom logs on outside AWS, you will need the CW Agent
- **Event** - registers events for when AWS services do certain activities (an EC2 is created, or stops etc)

#### Namespace
This is sort of a container for logically separating data

For instance all AWS data goes into a namespace called AWS/Service Name (eg, AWS/EC2)
#### Metrics
A metric is a collection of related data points ordered by time, for instance, disk usage, CPU use or Disk IO are all metrics
- But its important to note a **metric** is **not for a specific server**, for example, CPU Usage is the metric, but it could be **receiving data from many sources** 

**Datapoints** are what are registered whenever something sends its data to a specific metric. They have Timestamps and Values

**Dimensions** are a type of metadata that are sent in when a datapoint is registered. This allows datapoints within a single metric to be separated out for different perspectives  
- For instance, when an EC2 sends its CPU usage, it automatically sends **Instance ID** and **Instance Type**. This means when viewing the metric, we can use these dimensions to filter the data, to see the CPU usage for that specific instance

#### Alarms

These are configured in relation to a metric, where a certain criteria will take an alarm from the **OK** state to the **Alarm** state
- based on these states, the Alarm can take actions, from simple to complex
