### Ingredients:

1 Cabbage (napa/wombok)
Salt (2.5% by weight)

**Other Veggies:**
- Daikon
- Carrot
- Green Onion
- Nashi Pear
- Chives

**Paste:**
- 1/4cup fish sauce
- Ginger
- 1 onion
- 15 cloves garlic
- fermented shrimp/crab paste OR fermented salted shrimp (saeujeot)
- 1 cup gochugaru (amount will depend on taste for spiciness and brand)
- 1 oyster (optional) (dont blitz)
- Rice slurry, optional:
	- 1 cup water
	- 1.5 Tbsp sugar
	- 1.5 Tbsp sweet white rice flour 


**Method:**
1. slice cabbage, salt and roughly massage
	1. You can either slice into large pieces, OR slice to leave the core intact and salt in between the leaves
	2. Here you either salt and expect to use the (2.5%) brine that results OR salt **heavily** over ratio and expect to wash the cabbage after it has leeched its water
2. Leave for **at least** 1, 15 hours to extract water, massage every 30 mins
3. blitz paste, add slurry, mix to combine
4. When cabbage has leeched a bunch of water, you can cut it up a little or leave it intact
5. Add other veggies, prepped to preference (thin slices, thick matchstick, whatever)
6. Add paste, mix thoroughly by hand (gloves HIGHLY recommended)
7. Place into your fermentation vessel, tamping down as you put it in (to remove air bubbles). Ensure all veg is below the liquid line
