Individual secret agendas
- You are the Captain of the Tempest, the vessel lease is in your name. That lease has been running in the red for some time, you need this job and the money it pays to prevent repossession of the ship.....or of you; Everyone will suffer is the contract fails, but the lease debt could even land you onto to a "Debt Reclamation Project" on some faraway godforsaken planet for the corporation.
- You owe money to dangerous people. A **lot** of money to **very** dangerous people. You received a coded message to get on the crew of the Tempest and retrieve a data tape from 'Mike'. Bring us the tape, wipe away the debt.
- You have been additionally contracted by **Ishiyama Dynamics** (owners of the station) to retrieve a biological sample from **Dr. Giovanni**. There are concerns that other corporate agents are involved, thus the crew of the Tempest and of Ypsilon-14 should not be informed of this objective. Payment received for this work will be substantial.
- You have been additionally contracted by **Wolfram Heavy Industries** to preferably intercept or at least destroy a biological sample that is being retrieved by a corporate agent of the station owners (**Ishiyama Dynamics**). It is suspected that one of the crew of the Tempest is this agent and will be retrieving the sample. This is an act of denial-able corporate espionage, so leave no trace you were ever at the station.
- You have recently joined the company, you are adamant on keeping your record clean. This is the first job of many on your journey of promotions. Whether you are a Company lapdog and stooge is up to you, but you are on this crew to build a career, and the quickest way to do that is be useful to the company...or clean up it's messes.
