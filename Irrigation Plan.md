**materials**:
25m mainline
enough drip to cover beds (4 - 2m x 1m, 2 - 3m x 1m)
5 spaghetti lines for potato bags

==Fittings (for main):==
8 isolation valves
6 t fittings
1 cross fitting
14 elbows
caps for ends of lines

==Fittings (for beds)==

back-flow preventer

clips for securing fittings


**Questions:**
1. In the beds, should I have a header and footer? or just a header?
2. should I have this system operate as a loop instead of capping at the end?
3. where should I put the flush valve?
4. how should I handle temp drippers for potatoes etc
