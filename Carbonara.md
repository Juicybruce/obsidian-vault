using the [Bon Appetit simple carbonara recipe ](https://web.archive.org/web/20250111173340/https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/simple-carbonara) as a base, with alterations from [Serious Eats](https://www.seriouseats.com/pasta-carbonara-sauce-recipe)

Modifications:
- reduce amount of liquid in pasta water + egg white as the recipe can struggle to get creamy enough when emulsifying sauce

**Serves**: 4

**Ingredients:**
- 115g guanciale (cut into strips)
- 500g spaghetti, bucatini, or rigatoni
- **Sauce Mixture**
	- 55g Parmesan or Pecorino Romano (or both)
	- 5 large egg yolks
	- 2 large eggs
	- Freshly ground black pepper

**Method**

1. Combine sauce mixture into bowl (whisk eggs first, then add cheese)
2. Cook guanciale, reserve 3TBsp of fat (I mean....if it looks like a enormous amount)
3. Cook pasta until a little under, drain and reserve water
4. Bring fat and some pasta water up to a boil, put in pasta and cook until pasta is finished and water has mostly reduced
5. add a little pasta water to the sauce mixture and slowly stream in to the pasta OFF THE HEAT while stirring vigorously to emulsify, add most guanciale back in
	1. Thin with more pasta water if necessary
6. Serve in warm bowls, top with remaining guanciale and fresh pepper
