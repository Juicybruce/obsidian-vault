[James Hoffman - The Ultimate V60 Technique](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AI4ynXzkSQo&t=630s)


> [!NOTE] Notes
> **Brew ratio**: 60 g/L (e.g. 30 g per 500 mL)  
> **Grind size**: medium fine  
> **Temperature**: the hotter, the better (especially with lighter roasts)


- Grind **30 g of coffee** 
- **Rinse paper filter** with water just off the boil (This removes any paper taste and preheats the brewer )

- Add coffee grounds to V60 
- **Create well** in the middle of the grounds (*This helps to evenly saturate all the grounds during the blooming phase*)
- Add 2x coffee weight = 60 g of bloom water (*Don’t use more than 3x coffee weight*)
- **Swirl the coffee slurry** until evenly mixed. 

- **Bloom** for up to 45 s
- **Add water** **aiming for 60%** of total brew weight = 300 g in the next 30 s  
- **Add water aiming for 100%** of the total brew weight = 500 g in the next 30 s. (Poor a little slower than in the first phase)
  
- **Stir** 1x clockwise and 1x anticlockwise with spoon 
- Give V60 a **gentle swirl** 

- Let brew **drawdown** 


***Enjoy!***
